<p><strong>Friday the 13th</strong>, for that matter. Not that that matters.</p>

<p>I’m testing out <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blogging from the command line.</p>

<p>It gives me a nostalgic satisfaction of learning how to code Greymatter CGI for the first time, when I started blogging back in 2001 or so.</p>

<p>I didn’t get Jekyll to work right away. The website promised it would be easy. Not so, not for me. Yes, Mercury is retrograde.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory commands that worked today, separately, were:</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm implode
</code></pre>

<p>(Me deciding rvm was absolutely worthless.)</p>

<p>Then, I compiled Ruby from source, and magically all my problems dissolved.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo gem install jekyll
</code></pre>

<p>Yess! Success!</p>

<p>(If the SEO bots catch on, I searched relentlessly for a fix to the <em>zlib loaderror</em> I kept running into using ‘gem install’. So, I had rvm go screw itself then compiled Ruby manually. This installed all dependencies and fixed everything.)</p>

<p>That is all.</p>
