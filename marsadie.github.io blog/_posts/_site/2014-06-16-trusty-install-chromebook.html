<p>The weekend was dedicated to relaxing, spending one day with family and one day alone. Saturday my sister, her children, and I did dinner, then had ice cream. Sunday I took myself to brunch. Too much sashimi thrust me into a midday ~~coma~~ nap.</p>

<p>Of course, I had some ongoing freelance work to wrap up as well. Weekends tend to be workdays to some extent as well after starting a full-time job post self-employment.</p>

<p>But my nerd highlight of the weekend was -finally- getting Ubuntu onto my Chromebook. Afterward it essentially turns into a dualboot system (kind of), but one much more robust. For the purists that believe that a Chromebook is meant to remain a simple, Google-powered netbook - where’s the fun in that?!</p>

<p>On my Samsung Chromebook (ARM) I pressed Esc+Refresh+Power to cycle into Developer Mode. Wait a moment. Press Enter. Then, wait for it to delete your local files (which you’ll want to back up beforehand) before booting into what looks like a fresh Chrome OS environment.</p>

<p>The difference is, now you are able to type Ctrl+Alt+T to bring up a Terminal ~window~~ tab.</p>

<p>I had decided I wanted to install Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty. Both my Windows machine at home and my machine at work are running 12.04. Old, buggy, yet familiar. In with the new (and stable)!</p>

<pre><code>shell
</code></pre>

<p>That takes you into a shell environment where you are able to tinker to your heart’s content. (Careful, don’t break anything…)</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton/ -r trusty -t xfce
</code></pre>

<p>The xfce desktop is fugly at best but I couldn’t figure out how to install Unity straight off. Alas, the installation is well off and at this point I took a shower and did my makeup while letting it finish.</p>

<p>Once I returned it asked for a username and password. Success!</p>

<p>Afterward, you’ll want to enter</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo startxfce4
</code></pre>

<p>If you installed using xfce to switch into your [Trusty] new Linux environment.</p>

<p>Spiffy!</p>
