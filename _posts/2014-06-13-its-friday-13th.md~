title: It's Friday...

**Friday the 13th**, for that matter. Not that that matters.

I'm testing out [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blogging from the command line.

It gives me a satisfaction nostalgic of learning how to code Greymatter CGI for the first time, when I started blogging back in 2001 or so.

I didn't get Jekyll to work right away. The website promised it would be easy. Not so, not for me. Yes, Mercury is retrograde.

The most satisfactory commands that worked today, separately, were:

	$ rvm implode

(Me deciding rvm was absolutely worthless.)

Then, I compiled Ruby from source, and magically all my problems dissolved.

	$ sudo gem install jekyll

Yess! Success!

(In case the SEO bots catch on, I searched relentlessly for a fix to the *zlib loaderror* I kept running into using 'gem install'. So, I had rvm go screw itself then compiled Ruby manually. This installed all dependencies and fixed everything.)

That is all.
