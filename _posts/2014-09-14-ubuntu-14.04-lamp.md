title: LAMP, WordPress, and Forge theming on Ubuntu 14.04
---

I wanted to do a quick post on setting up LAMP, WordPress, then ultimately using Forge for WordPress theming on Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.

Rather than write my own guide, I'll link to a helpful post that guided me through the process of installing LAMP and WordPress locally on Ubuntu 14.04:

&bull; [How To Install Wordpress on Ubuntu 12.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-on-ubuntu-12-04)

Since the author wrote the guide for 12.04, here's my tip to save you some time and headache:

Anywhere /var/www/ is mentioned, use /var/www**/html**/ instead since that's where Apache sets up sites on 14.04.

For example, instead of using these commands to grant Apache ownership:

	sudo chown username:www-data /var/www -R
	sudo chmod g+w /var/www -R 

Use:

	sudo chown username:www-data /var/www/html -R 
	sudo chmod g+w /var/www/html -R 

This ensures your LAMP setup will work on 14.04. _The more you know._

Though she mentions it, for future reference - all you need to do to grab a copy of the latest WordPress tarball is command:

	wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

Regarding [Forge](http://forge.thethemefoundry.com), I have yet to use it, but I plan to for theming freelance WordPress projects on Linux. It comes equipped with CSS compilers and all the tools needed to produce a neat little WordPress theme file ready for upload. The project hasn't been updated in a while so I'm hoping it's still operational.

If you know of a better/updated workflow for theming WP on Linux, I'd love to know.
